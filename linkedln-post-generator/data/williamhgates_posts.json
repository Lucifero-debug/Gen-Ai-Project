But Iâ€™ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.\n\nThatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and itâ€™s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.\n\nTheyâ€™ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.\n\nItâ€™s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.\n\nAnd now, Iâ€™ll be doing the same.\n\nLooking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I wonâ€™t break anything (no promises).\n\nðŸ“²Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com\n\nðŸ’»Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com\n\nLet me know what you think! You never know whoâ€™s on the other end of the customer service lineâ€¦",
