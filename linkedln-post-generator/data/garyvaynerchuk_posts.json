Period, you’ve got another 49….now what!\n\nImagine how I feel about people under 40 in this community ❤️❤️❤️",

            "content": "Gary Vaynerchuk\nGary Vaynerchuk Kindness is misunderstood...\n\nEspecially in the business world, too many people think it’s all about being hard, tough, ambitious, or having grit. Yes, these things are important, but trust me — that’s not where we’re lacking as a collective. We have the “hard things” down. I think it’s actually the “soft things” that are harder to master, and I think kindness is a real foundation to why soft skills are so important in life and business. \n\nLike a lot of the emotional ingredients, we think of kindness as a “nice to have” when really, it’s a must. We don’t think about kindness as a fucking foundation to business success! We don’t think that being kind is going to make us rich, however, you’ll be surprised at how kindness can impact your business and career as a whole. \n\n🔵 What People Misunderstand About Kindness: \nA lot of it comes down to fear. People are scared that they’re gonna fail, that they’re gonna be taken advantage of, etc. So, instead of being kind, they throw their defenses up. Trust me, being kind isn’t a sign of weakness. The truth is, kindness is a strength that is greatly underrated. \n\n🔵 Why You Should Be Kind When it’s Hard:\nI say it all the time… it’s easy to be kind when it’s easy. What I mean by that is that it comes naturally to us to show kindness to people who are kind to us, people who give us what we want, or people who we know we’ve wronged. What’s harder is being kind when it’s hard. \nCan you be the bigger person when someone has wronged you? Can you deploy kindness even when the other person won’t apologize or admit that they’ve done something fucked up? That’s when kindness really counts. Why? It’s not about letting people off the hook…it’s about understanding that we never really know what another person is going through. \n\n🔵 Balancing Kindness with Candor:\nWhile it’s important to be kind to those who have wronged you, it’s equally as important to hold people accountable. This is where kind candor comes in. \n\n🔵 Kindness Starts with YOU:\nI think how kind a person is to others is a direct reflection of how kind they are to themselves. When we’re always judging ourselves, it’s easy to judge others…but when we show ourselves compassion, respect, and kindness, those are the things we give to the people around us as well.",

To me, culture drives the organization at the core and if that’s ruined, nothing else matters.\n\nThen, I sit down with them and try to have a conversation.\n\nI take the blame first because it’s my company and every problem is my fault - I ask them what I’ve done wrong to put them in a position where they feel like they have to act that way.\n\nAre they not clicking with someone they’re working with? Is something going on at home? What am I missing?\n\nI also spend 80% of our meeting trying to make them feel safe and penetrate any insecurities that might be the source of the issues.\n\nSometimes, the person will turn their behavior around in a couple of months. Other times, it'll continue and I'll let them go.\n\nIf their bad behavior continues and you’re a CEO who keeps them around because they’re hitting their targets, you’re sending a clear message to other employees about what you really think about company culture.",
