Operate in Your Zone of Genius\n\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\n\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win. \n\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\n2. Adopt a Positive Sum Mentality\n\nWant to get ahead in life? Start genuinely rooting for others to succeed.\n\nWhen one of us wins, we all win‚Äîwinning spreads. If you adopt that mentality, you‚Äôll become a magnet for the highest quality people.\n\n3. Speak Up\n\nClosed mouths don‚Äôt get fed. A little push goes a long way.\n\nDon't sit back and wait for good things to happen. If you want something‚Äîand you‚Äôve put in the work for it‚Äîspeak up and ask for it.\n\nWorst Case: you‚Äôre told no and nothing has changed.\n\nBest Case: it‚Äôs yours.\n\n4. Play Long-Term Games\n\nLife is the ultimate long game.\n\nThose with low time preference play it more effectively‚Äîthey happily delay gratification to allow compounding to work its magic.\n\nIn a world of people seeking instant gratification, this is a meaningful edge.\n\n5. Have a High Tolerance for Failure\n\nWe fear failure, so most of us play it safe to avoid it. But our greatest moments of growth often stem directly from our greatest failures.\n\nDon't accept failure, but don't fear it either.\n\nYou will fail. Embrace it. Fail smart and fast.\n\n6. Follow Your Curiosity\n\nHumans are born with astonishing curiosity. But somewhere along the way, we're told to stop asking questions.\n\nPush back.\n\nLearn to follow your curiosity‚Äîtrust it. For the curious mind, anything is possible. Fortune favors the curious.\n\n7. Adopt a Process Orientation\n\nPrioritize process, not outcomes.\nWhen you prioritize process, you become flexible in where you are headed‚Äîyou focus on the inputs and stop worrying about the outputs.\n\nJust keep laying one brick at a time‚Äîforward progress is all that matters.\n\n8. Prioritize People\n\nEverything in life comes down to people and relationships.\n\nNetworks compound as well as any financial investment. Build an army of mentors, friends, and evangelists that is deep and wide. Cultivate deep relationships, but also embrace the power of weak ties.\n\n9. Work Like a Lion\n\nModern work culture is a remnant of the Industrial Age. It encourages long periods of steady, monotonous work unsuited for the Information Age.\n\nIf your goal is to do inspired, creative work, you have to work as a lion works.\n\nSprint when inspired. Rest. Repeat.\n\nüëâ If you want more systems like these, grab The 5 Types of Wealth: https://lnkd.in/eUzjZUxj\n\nP.S.

            "content": "Sahil Bloom\nSahil Bloom I left millions on the table to start writing online.\n\nOne story gave me the courage to do it:\n\nThere's an old fable about Christopher Columbus that goes something like this‚Ä¶\n\nIn 1493, after his first voyage to the Americas, Columbus attended a dinner with Spanish nobles who dismissed his accomplishment:\n\n\"Anyone could have sailed west and found land.\"\n\nColumbus smiled, reached for a boiled egg, and proposed a simple wager:\n\n\"Stand this egg on its tip, and I'll concede your point.\"\n\nOne by one, the nobles tried. One by one, they failed. Frustration filled the room.\n\nColumbus then took the same egg, gave the tip a gentle tap that flattened a sliver of shell, and set it upright.\n\n\"Once you see the move, it feels inevitable,\" he said.\n\nHere's the lesson that changed my life:\n\nObvious is a post-achievement label.\n\nBreakthroughs are obvious only in hindsight.\n\nThat view erases the struggle, the ridicule, and the failure absorbed by the pioneer along the way.\n\nRecent history proves this pattern:\n\n‚Ä¢ A prominent venture capitalist called Airbnb a ‚Äúserial killer app‚Äù for its \nidea of strangers sleeping on your couch\n‚Ä¢Incumbents ridiculed Apple for removing the keyboard when it launched the iPhone\n‚Ä¢Blockbuster execs shrugged off Netflix when approached about an acquisition\n\nThe best ideas look crazy‚Äîuntil someone does them.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the idea sitting in your Notes app that feels obvious to you but crazy to everyone else?\n\nTrue innovation is met with ridicule at the outset. Enduring it is the cost of entry for anyone who wants to alter the status quo.\n\nInnovation is about everyone agreeing with you...later.\n\nüëâ For mental models that help you bet on yourself, grab The 5 Types of Wealth: https://lnkd.in/eUzjZUxj\n\nP.S.

            "content": "Sahil Bloom\nSahil Bloom I spent 10 years feeling behind in life. \n\nThe mindset shift that changed everything:\n\nFocus on your trend-line, not your position.\n\nWe‚Äôve all felt it‚Äîthat knot in your chest when a friend announces the promotion, the bonus, the new house. A daily highlight reel reminds you exactly where they are‚Äì‚Äìand where you aren‚Äôt.\n\nEvery single piece of information is a snapshot of their position that you can't help but compare yourself to.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt called comparison ‚Äúthe thief of joy,‚Äù but the real villain isn‚Äôt comparison itself‚Äîit‚Äôs the snapshot focus on where you stand right now.\n\nShift the lens to your trend. If you plotted your life like a chart, would you rather be the person at a high point drifting sideways‚Äîor the one starting lower but compounding upward every day?\n\nTrend-thinking is pro-agentic. It says, I can‚Äôt alter today‚Äôs coordinates, but I can tilt the slope of tomorrow. That slope is forged in the mundane‚Äîcontrollable habits, routines, mindsets.\n\nThree quick checks to reset your focus:\n\n 1. If I copied today 100 times, would my trend rise or fall?\n\n 2. Which single habit, done daily for 30 days, would bend my curve most?\n\n 3. What subtle evidence of growth did I miss last month?\n\nStop self-inflicting misery with snapshot envy. Return to your craft. Stack tiny wins until the graph can‚Äôt hide them.\n\nTrust in the trend.\n\nüëâ If this resonated, grab The 5 Types of Wealth‚Äîmy guide to building rich relationships and a life of meaning: https://lnkd.in/eUzjZUxj\n\nP.S.

Order now: https://lnkd.in/evRUAQAH\n\nI'd love to hear from you: What do you think of the story?\n\nAre you more fisherman or more banker?\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be the fisherman‚ÄîI‚Äôm wired to strive for growth‚Äîbut I do think we can all see a little bit of the fisherman in ourselves.\n\nAnd letting that inner fisherman shine through from time to time will lead to all of us living happier, more fulfilled lives.\n\nThe book explores the inherent tension between your inner banker and inner fisherman in depth. It will help you navigate that tension, which becomes increasingly important when you have kids.\n\nI can't wait to hear what you think of it.",

            "content": "Sahil Bloom\nSahil Bloom My grandfather‚Äôs story changed everything:\n\nAs a kid, my grandfather had me sort his books.\n\nI rushed through the task, stacking the books sloppily so I could get back to whatever I was doing. When I told him I was done, he smiled and told me to sit down. Then he shared a story I‚Äôll never forget‚Ä¶\n\nAn old carpenter told his boss that he planned to retire. The boss was sad to lose the carpenter, but understood. He asked if he‚Äôd stick around for one last job‚Äîto build one final house.\n\nThe carpenter reluctantly agreed, figuring he could get it done quickly. He cut corners, used cheap materials, and rushed through the work.\n\nWhen the house was done, his boss arrived for the final inspection. But instead of walking the house, he reached into his pocket, and handed the carpenter the keys.\n\n‚ÄúThis is your house,‚Äù his boss smiled, ‚ÄúMy retirement gift to you.‚Äù\n\nThe carpenter was stunned. If he‚Äôd known he was building his own house, he would have done it differently. Now he‚Äôd have to live in a house he had built none too well.\n\nThe lesson my grandfather shared with me that day: You‚Äôre always building your own house.\n\nEvery single day, the way you show up determines the quality of the house you‚Äôll live in‚Äîprofessionally, relationally, and physically.\n\nCut corners, rush, and you‚Äôll live with it.\nNail the details, invest in quality, and you‚Äôll live with it.\n\nEverything matters. Every email, every conversation, every meal, every workout‚Äîthese small actions lay bricks in the house you‚Äôll inhabit.\n\nBecause how you do one thing is how you do everything.\n\nIf this resonated, repost to your network ‚ôªÔ∏è and follow Sahil Bloom for more.\n\nWant my best thinking on self-improvement and growth?
