No traction.\n\nI thought I was doing everything right:\n\n• Giving away value\n• Writing \"good hooks\"\n• Trying all the different formats\n\nMy audience was growing.\nMy engagement was solid.\n\nBut my business? Stuck.\n\nHere was my big early mistake:\n\nI was creating content to impress, not to convert.\n\nNo demand signals.\nNo clear positioning.\nNo buyer-specific narrative.\n\nJust “more content.”\n\nThen I built a simple system to flip it:\n\n• Posts that attract the right people\n• Styles that show off expertise\n• Value that builds trust\n• Offers people want\n• CTAs that feel relevant\n\nThat system became the backbone of my business.\n\nIt’s how I turned my LinkedIn profile into:\n\n• $10.5M in revenue\n• 42,000+ customers\n• All with zero sales calls\n\nIf you're posting content that gets views but not revenue?\n\nYou're not missing followers.\nYou're missing signal.\n\nThis will fix that → https://lnkd.in/eh9pVVuf",
