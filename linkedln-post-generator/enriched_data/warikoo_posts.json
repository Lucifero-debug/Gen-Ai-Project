But start.\n\n- Script your pushback: \u201cI understand the urgency, but I\u2019ll need until X to do this well.\u201d \nFirm. Respectful. Clear.\n\n- Stop apologizing for not knowing enough. \nNobody knows everything. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to ask. \nYou\u2019re allowed to not have been everywhere. \nYou\u2019re allowed to learn in real time.\n\nThis version of you - the quiet one, the one who makes herself smaller - is a story that needs to stop. \n\nTime to write a better one.\n\nImage via Colby Kultgen and Ben Meer",
