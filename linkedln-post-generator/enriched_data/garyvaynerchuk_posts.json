        "content": "Gary Vaynerchuk\nGary Vaynerchuk Kindness is misunderstood...\n\nEspecially in the business world, too many people think it\u2019s all about being hard, tough, ambitious, or having grit. Yes, these things are important, but trust me \u2014 that\u2019s not where we\u2019re lacking as a collective. We have the \u201chard things\u201d down. I think it\u2019s actually the \u201csoft things\u201d that are harder to master, and I think kindness is a real foundation to why soft skills are so important in life and business. \n\nLike a lot of the emotional ingredients, we think of kindness as a \u201cnice to have\u201d when really, it\u2019s a must. We don\u2019t think about kindness as a fucking foundation to business success! We don\u2019t think that being kind is going to make us rich, however, you\u2019ll be surprised at how kindness can impact your business and career as a whole. \n\n\ud83d\udd35 What People Misunderstand About Kindness: \nA lot of it comes down to fear. People are scared that they\u2019re gonna fail, that they\u2019re gonna be taken advantage of, etc. So, instead of being kind, they throw their defenses up. Trust me, being kind isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. The truth is, kindness is a strength that is greatly underrated. \n\n\ud83d\udd35 Why You Should Be Kind When it\u2019s Hard:\nI say it all the time\u2026 it\u2019s easy to be kind when it\u2019s easy. What I mean by that is that it comes naturally to us to show kindness to people who are kind to us, people who give us what we want, or people who we know we\u2019ve wronged. What\u2019s harder is being kind when it\u2019s hard. \nCan you be the bigger person when someone has wronged you? Can you deploy kindness even when the other person won\u2019t apologize or admit that they\u2019ve done something fucked up? That\u2019s when kindness really counts. Why? It\u2019s not about letting people off the hook\u2026it\u2019s about understanding that we never really know what another person is going through. \n\n\ud83d\udd35 Balancing Kindness with Candor:\nWhile it\u2019s important to be kind to those who have wronged you, it\u2019s equally as important to hold people accountable. This is where kind candor comes in. \n\n\ud83d\udd35 Kindness Starts with YOU:\nI think how kind a person is to others is a direct reflection of how kind they are to themselves. When we\u2019re always judging ourselves, it\u2019s easy to judge others\u2026but when we show ourselves compassion, respect, and kindness, those are the things we give to the people around us as well.",

To me, culture drives the organization at the core and if that\u2019s ruined, nothing else matters.\n\nThen, I sit down with them and try to have a conversation.\n\nI take the blame first because it\u2019s my company and every problem is my fault - I ask them what I\u2019ve done wrong to put them in a position where they feel like they have to act that way.\n\nAre they not clicking with someone they\u2019re working with? Is something going on at home? What am I missing?\n\nI also spend 80% of our meeting trying to make them feel safe and penetrate any insecurities that might be the source of the issues.\n\nSometimes, the person will turn their behavior around in a couple of months. Other times, it'll continue and I'll let them go.\n\nIf their bad behavior continues and you\u2019re a CEO who keeps them around because they\u2019re hitting their targets, you\u2019re sending a clear message to other employees about what you really think about company culture.",
